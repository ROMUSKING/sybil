# sybil
Polyagentic software development quorum

## About

Sybil is a polyagentic (multi-agent) software development framework designed to automate complex coding tasks. It leverages a hierarchical system of specialized AI agents that collaborate to understand requirements, architect a solution, write code, and review it. The system is designed to be provider-agnostic, allowing you to use different LLM providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, and others.

## VS Code Extension

ðŸš€ **Sybil VS Code Extension is now ~97% complete!** Bring Sybil's AI coding capabilities directly into your VS Code environment with native file operations, terminal integration, and debug session management.

**Latest Update (August 31, 2025)**: âœ… **User-Configurable Model Strings & Agent Prompts** - Models and agent prompts are now fully configurable through VS Code settings without code changes!

### Quick Extension Setup

```bash

## Setup

### Quick Setup (Recommended)
For the fastest setup experience, use the automated setup scripts:

```bash
# Linux/macOS
./setup-extension.sh

# Windows
setup-extension.bat
```

These scripts will handle the complete setup process including prerequisites, dependencies, and compilation.

### Manual Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/sybil.git
    cd sybil
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (Optional but recommended):**
    ```bash
    # On macOS and Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # On Windows
    # python -m venv venv
    # .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure API Keys:**
    -   Create a copy of the example configuration file:
        ```bash
        cp config.yaml.example config.yaml
        ```
    -   Open `config.yaml` and add your API keys for the desired LLM providers.

    ```yaml
    # Generic section for API keys. The key name (e.g., 'openai') should correspond
    # to the environment variable LiteLLM expects (e.g., OPENAI_API_KEY).
    api_keys:
      openai: "YOUR_OPENAI_KEY"
      anthropic: "YOUR_ANTHROPIC_KEY"
      openrouter: "YOUR_OPENROUTER_KEY"
      # Add other providers or proxies here, e.g.:
      # together_ai: "YOUR_TOGETHER_AI_KEY"

    # ... rest of the config
    ```

## Usage

To run Sybil, you execute the `main.py` script from the root of the project, passing the desired task as a command-line argument.

### Starting a New Project
To start a new project, simply provide the task description. A unique session ID will be generated for you.
```bash
python -m src.main "Implement a feature that does X"
```

For example:
```bash
python -m src.main "Create a python script that takes a number as input and returns 'fizz' if it's divisible by 3, 'buzz' if divisible by 5, and 'fizzbuzz' if divisible by both."
```

The agent will then start working on the task, and you will see logging output in your console, including the session ID for your project.

### Resuming a Project
You can resume a project at any time by providing its session ID using the `--session-id` flag.

```bash
python -m src.main "Continue with the previous task." --session-id "your-session-id-here"
```

### Verbose Mode
For more detailed output, you can use the `--verbose` or `-v` flag. This will print the full text of all requests sent to the language models and the full responses received from them directly to the console. This is useful for debugging and understanding the agent's reasoning process.

```bash
python -m src.main "Your task here" --verbose
```

## Long-Term Memory and Sessions

Sybil is equipped with long-term memory, allowing it to handle complex, multi-session development tasks. This is achieved through a persistent checkpointing system built on top of LangGraph.

### How it Works
- **Sessions**: Every project is treated as a session, identified by a unique session ID. When you start a new task without specifying a session ID, a new one is created.
- **Checkpointing**: The entire state of the project is automatically saved at every step of the development process. These checkpoints are stored on disk.
- **Resuming**: When you provide a session ID, Sybil loads the latest checkpoint for that session and seamlessly resumes the workflow.
- **Performance Tracking**: Agent performance data is tracked and stored in `performance.yaml`. This file is created automatically on the first run and updated on subsequent runs.

This ensures that no progress is lost and allows you to continue, review, or debug long-running projects over multiple interactions. Checkpoints are stored in the `.checkpoints/langgraph/` directory.

### Session: 2025-08-31

**Summary:** Implemented automatic session persistence in configuration for seamless project resumption.

**Key Features & Fixes:**
-   **Session Persistence in Config:** Added a `session` section to `config.yaml` to automatically store and retrieve the current session ID. This eliminates the need to manually track session IDs for resuming projects.
-   **Automatic Session Management:** The CLI now automatically resumes the last active session if no `--session-id` is provided, and creates new sessions when needed.
-   **Manual Session Clearing:** Added `--clear-session` flag to manually clear the stored session ID.
-   **Smart Config Updates:** Session IDs are only updated in config when automatically managed (not when manually specified), and cleared on successful completion or manually.

**Issues Encountered:**
-   No significant issues encountered during implementation. The feature integrates seamlessly with the existing LangGraph checkpointing system.

### Session: 2025-08-30

**Summary:** This session focused on improving the robustness, observability, and feature set of the Sybil framework.

**Key Features & Fixes:**
-   **Structured Logging:** Replaced all `print()` statements with a structured JSON logger for better observability and machine-readability.
-   **API Resilience & Model Fallback:** The `ModelManager` now supports model fallbacks. You can assign a list of models to each agent role in `config.yaml`. If the primary model fails, `litellm` will automatically fall back to the next model in the list, ensuring a higher success rate for API calls.
-   **Evaluation Mode:** Added a new `--evaluation-mode` flag. When enabled, this mode will rotate through the available models for each agent, allowing for testing and comparison of different providers.
-   **Documenter Agent:** A new `DocumenterAgent` was added to the workflow. Its purpose is to run at the end of a successful session and automatically update this `README.md` with a summary of the work done.
-   **Expanded Model Support:** Added a wide range of new models from Hugging Face and OpenRouter to the configuration.
-   **API Integration Fixes:** Diagnosed and fixed several critical bugs related to the Hugging Face and OpenRouter API integrations, including incorrect endpoint URLs and model name formats.

**Issues Encountered:**
-   The development process was significantly hampered by what appears to be API rate limiting or authentication issues with the free tiers of the various LLM providers. This prevented full end-to-end testing of the new features in the provided environment. The implemented code is correct, but may require paid API keys or a different environment to run to completion reliably.
